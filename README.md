# Coursera_getting_and_cleaning_data_R
Peer graded assignement 


The description of the assignment:

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

In the run_analysis.R file the code are included. The code depicted the following steps of analyis

1   loading the data
2   Including the activity code and subject code to the two datasets
3   Merging the train and test set
4   Extract measurments on the mean and the standard deviations of each measurement
5   Use descriptive names to name activities in the data set 
6   Rename variables to descriptive names 
7   Form a tidy data set

I have used the following R-packages:
readr
dplyr
tibble
tidr
stringr
